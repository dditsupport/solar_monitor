-- Migration: rename the `devices` table to `energy_devices`.
-- Safe on InnoDB: foreign keys in device_meta and solar_readings that
-- reference the old name are auto-updated to point at the new name.
-- Apply once via phpMyAdmin (SQL tab) or `mysql -u <user> -p <db> < this.sql`.
--
-- Idempotent: skips the rename if `devices` is already gone.
